CODE OF CONDUCT:
Team Collaboration and Communication:
•	All team members, when joining an internal team meeting/discussion, must actively participate in the meeting/discussion.
•	Each team member should first listen to the other members’ opinions and ideas during discussions without interrupting them. They should then respectfully agree or disagree and present their own opinion. A vote will be taken on whose idea to proceed with and the idea with the majority vote will be chosen.

In such a scenario, the team member facing the issue should inform the team at most 24 hours (1 day) prior to the unforeseen event occurring.
Individual Contribution:
Each team member should: 
•	Attend all 4 project sprint review meetings with the Software Development 2 module tutor (Dr. Lisa Haskell) and actively participate in these discussions.
•	Regularly contribute to the project's GitHub repository and task board. 
•	Document and commit code changes with clear and meaningful commit messages. 
•	Seek help from team members or the Software Development 2 module delivery team (Lisa and Krystian) if you face any difficulties or need support. This is in case you do not have a laptop, or if a certain software tool is unable to be installed on your personal laptop.
Code Quality:
Each team member should:
•	Follow good code practices, including proper code indentation and meaningful variable and function names.
•	Maintain code comments for all major functions, variables, and non-trivial algorithms.

•	Adhere to the deadlines for each sprint and individual reflection.
•	Inform the team promptly (as early as possible) if you anticipate difficulties in meeting a deadline.
•	Discuss any deadline extensions with the team before making commitments.
Respect for Code of Conduct:
•	Follow the above Code of Conduct defined by the team for conflict resolution.
•	Address breaches of the Code of Conduct professionally and through the appropriate channels.
•	Team members have the right to appeal any dismissal decision within one week, providing suitable evidence.
Technical Deliverables:
All team members should:
•	actively contribute to and monitor the GitHub repository and task board.
•	The website application must be developed using the technologies specified in the coursework specification.
